# ZEST Protocol: Bitcoin-Native Stablecoin Ecosystem ðŸš€

## Overview

ZEST Protocol is a groundbreaking Bitcoin-native stablecoin ecosystem built on the Citrea network. By leveraging Bitcoin's unparalleled security and Citrea's EVM-compatible scalability, ZEST creates a robust financial layer that bridges traditional finance with decentralized innovation.

The protocol uses cBTC as its core collateral to mint ZEST, a USD-pegged stablecoin, ensuring enhanced financial stability and liquidity. Our ecosystem features overcollateralized debt positions (CDPs), a Stability Pool for liquidations, and a staking protocol that issues yield-bearing sZEST tokens.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Smart Contract System**

   - Solidity-based contracts deployed on Citrea L2
   - Modular design for easy upgrades and maintenance
   - Gas-optimized for efficient transaction processing

2. **Collateral Management**

   - cBTC as primary collateral asset
   - Dynamic collateral ratios based on market conditions
   - Automated liquidation mechanisms for risk management

3. **Stability Mechanisms**

   - Overcollateralization requirements (minimum 110%)
   - Stability Pool for absorbing liquidated positions
   - Redemption mechanism for maintaining peg stability

4. **Yield Generation**
   - Borrower interest distribution
   - Liquidation rewards
   - Staking rewards through sZEST tokens

## Key Features

### 1. Overcollateralized Debt Positions (CDPs)

- Minimum collateral ratio: 110%
- Dynamic interest rates based on market conditions
- Automated liquidation triggers
- Partial liquidation support

### 2. Stability Pool

- Absorbs liquidated positions
- Distributes collateral bonuses to depositors
- Real-time reward calculations
- Emergency shutdown mechanism

### 3. Staking & Yield Generation

- sZEST token issuance
- Yield sources:
  - Borrower interest (70%)
  - Liquidation rewards (20%)
  - Protocol fees (10%)
- Compound interest mechanism

### 4. Seamless Swaps

- Fixed 1:1 USDT to ZEST conversion
- Zero slippage implementation
- Instant settlement
- Gas optimization for cost efficiency

## Development Setup

1. **Prerequisites**

   ```bash
   Node.js >= 18.x
   pnpm >= 8.x
   ```

2. **Installation**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/web3sim/zestprotocol.git
   cd zestprotocol
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Update environment variables
   ```

4. **Running the Stack**

   ```bash
   # Start backend
   pnpm run dev:backend

   # Start frontend
   pnpm run dev:frontend
   ```

## API Integration

The ZEST Protocol provides a comprehensive API for developers. Currently you can access it by spinning up the backend. But in the future, it would be as easy as doing something like this:

```typescript
import { ZestClient } from "@zest-protocol/sdk";

const client = new ZestClient({
  network: "testnet",
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
});

// Example: Create a CDP
const cdp = await client.cdp.create({
  collateral: "1.5", // cBTC
  debt: "1000", // ZEST
});
```

## Security Considerations

- All contracts are un-audited. This is a akindo buildathon project.
